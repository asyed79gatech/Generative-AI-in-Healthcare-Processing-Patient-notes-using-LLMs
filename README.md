# Extracting Structured Information from Unstructured Patient Notes using Open-Source LLMs

![Masthead](/Patinet Notes Processing.png)
## Motivation
In healthcare, accurate and efficient documentation is critical, but it can be a time-consuming process for medical professionals. This project addresses the challenge of automating the extraction of structured data from unstructured patient notes using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). By doing so, healthcare workers can focus more on patient care and less on administrative tasks.

The project was inspired by the 2023 Purdue "Data for Good" competition, which aimed to bridge healthcare needs with cutting-edge AI solutions. This system leverages open-source LLMs to process medical conversations and extract the necessary information to populate forms or databases.
