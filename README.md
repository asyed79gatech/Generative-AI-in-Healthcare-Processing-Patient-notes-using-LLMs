# Extracting Structured Information from Unstructured Patient Notes using Open-Source LLMs
In healthcare, accurate and efficient documentation is critical, but it can be a time-consuming process for medical professionals. This project addresses the challenge of automating the extraction of structured data from unstructured patient notes (patient-doctor conversation transcripts) using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). By doing so, healthcare workers can focus more on patient care and less on administrative tasks.

The project was inspired by the 2023 Purdue "Data for Good" competition, which aimed to bridge healthcare needs with cutting-edge AI solutions. This system leverages open-source LLMs to process medical conversations and extract the necessary information to populate forms or databases.

## Motivation
This project showcases the potential of open-source LLMs, prompt engineering, and data pre-processing to automate tasks for healthcare professionals. It gives an insight into imagining a world where healthcare workers and volunteers can focus entirely on patient care, free from the burden of time-consuming paperwork. It was particularly interesting because it is a prime example of how AI simplifies administrative processes, ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and security, while freeing up valuable time and resources.

## Technologies Used
**1- Python:** For data collection, preprocessing, and integration with LLMs.

**2- Open-Source LLMs:** Llama 2, MPT, Falcon, and others for natural language understanding and extraction.

**3- Libraries:**

- pandas and numpy for data manipulation.

- transformers for model integration.

- spacy for linguistic preprocessing.

- json for managing input/output data formats.
